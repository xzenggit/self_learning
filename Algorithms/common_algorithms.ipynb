    "* Brute Force: A brute-force algorithm solves a problem in the most simple, direct or obvious way. As a result, such an algorithm can end up doing far more work to solve a given problem than a more clever or sophisticated algorithm might do.  Typically, a brute-force algorithm solves a problem by exhaustively enumerating all the possibilities. \n",

    "* Divide and Conquer: works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same (or related) type (divide), until these become simple enough to be solved directly (conquer). The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.\n",

    "* Greedy Programming: an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage[1] with the hope of finding a global optimum. In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.\n",

    "### Greedy Algorithms Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some standard algorithms that are Greedy algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST): In Kruskal’s algorithm, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that doesn’t cause a cycle in the MST constructed so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree: In Prim’s algorithm also, we create a MST by picking edges one by one. We maintain two sets: set of the vertices already included in MST and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the smallest weight edge that connects the two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dijkstra’s Shortest Path: The Dijkstra’s algorithm is very similar to Prim’s algorithm. The shortest path tree is built up, edge by edge. We maintain two sets: set of the vertices already included in the tree and the set of the vertices not yet included. The Greedy Choice is to pick the edge that connects the two sets and is on the smallest weight path from source to the set that contains not yet included vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Huffman Coding: Huffman Coding is a loss-less compression technique. It assigns variable length bit codes to different characters. The Greedy Choice is to assign least bit length code to the most frequent character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithms are sometimes also used to get an approximation for Hard optimization problems. For example, Traveling Salesman Problem is a NP Hard problem. A Greedy choice for this problem is to pick the nearest unvisited city from the current city at every step. This solutions doesn’t always produce the best optimal solution, but can be used to get an approximate optimal solution.\n",

Otherwise, if x is less than the middle element, then the algorithm recurs for left side of middle element, else recurs for right side of middle element.\n",

    "2) Quicksort is a sorting algorithm.

Finally, the algorithm recursively sorts the subarrays on left and right of pivot element.\n",

It is therefore faster than the classical algorithm, which requires n2 single-digit products. If n = 210 = 1024, in particular, the exact counts are 310 = 59,049 and (210)2 = 1,048,576, respectively.\n",

    "The basic idea is that if you are given two arrays ar1[] and ar2[] and know the length of each, you can check whether an element ar1[i] is the median in constant time. Suppose that the median is ar1[i]. Since the array is sorted, it is greater than exactly i values in array ar1[]. Then if it is the median, it is also greater than exactly j = n – i – 1 elements in ar2[].\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires constant time to check if ar2[j] <= ar1[i] <= ar2[j + 1]. If ar1[i] is not the median, then depending on whether ar1[i] is greater or less than ar2[j] and ar2[j + 1], you know that ar1[i] is either greater than or less than the median. Thus you can binary search for median in O(lg n) worst-case time. For two arrays ar1 and ar2, first do binary search in ar1[]. If you reach at the end (left or right) of the first array and don't find median, start searching in the second array ar2[].\n",
