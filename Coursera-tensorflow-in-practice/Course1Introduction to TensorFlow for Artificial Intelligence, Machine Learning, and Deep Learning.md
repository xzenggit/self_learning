### Week1 A New Programming Paradigm

Exercise 1:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras
model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')
xs = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0], dtype=float)
ys = np.array([1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5], dtype=float)
model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=1000)
print(model.predict([7.0]))
```

### Week2 Introduction to Computer Vision

About Epoch:
* 1Epoch = 1 Forward pass + 1 Backward pass for ALL training samples.
* Batch Size = Number of training samples in 1 Forward/1 Backward pass. (With increase in Batch size, required memory space increases.)
* Number of iterations = Number of passes i.e. 1 Pass = 1 Forward pass + 1 Backward pass (Forward pass and Backward pass are not counted differently.)
Example : If we have 1000 training samples and Batch size is set to 500, it will take 2 iterations to complete 1 Epoch.

Earlier when you trained for extra epochs you had an issue where your loss might change. It might have taken a bit of time for you to wait for the training to do that, and you might have thought 'wouldn't it be nice if I could stop the training when I reach a desired value?' -- i.e. 95% accuracy might be enough for you, and if you reach that after 3 epochs, why sit around waiting for it to finish a lot more epochs....So how would you fix that? Like any other program...you have callbacks! Let's see them in action...

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)

class myCallback(tf.keras.callbacks.Callback):
  def on_epoch_end(self, epoch, logs={}):
    if(logs.get('loss')<0.4):
      print("\nReached 60% accuracy so cancelling training!")
      self.model.stop_training = True

callbacks = myCallback()
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
training_images=training_images/255.0
test_images=test_images/255.0
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation=tf.nn.relu),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy')
model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5, callbacks=[callbacks])
```

### Week3 Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print(tf.__version__)
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
training_images=training_images.reshape(60000, 28, 28, 1)
training_images=training_images / 255.0
test_images = test_images.reshape(10000, 28, 28, 1)
test_images=test_images/255.0
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=10)
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
print(test_acc)
```

### Week4 Using real-world images

```python
# Load data and labels from certain directories
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# All images will be rescaled by 1./255
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)
validation_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        '/tmp/horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=128,
        # Since we use binary_crossentropy loss, we need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
validation_generator = validation_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        '/tmp/validation-horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=32,
        # Since we use binary_crossentropy loss, we need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')

history = model.fit_generator(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=8,  
      epochs=15,
      verbose=1,
      validation_data = validation_generator,
      validation_steps=8)

# intermediate representations for all layers in the previous model after

# Rescale by 1/255
x /= 255

# Let's run our image through our network, thus obtaining all
# intermediate representations for this image.
successive_feature_maps = visualization_model.predict(x)

# These are the names of the layers, so can have them as part of our plot
layer_names = [layer.name for layer in model.layers]

# Now let's display our representations
for layer_name, feature_map in zip(layer_names, successive_feature_maps):
  if len(feature_map.shape) == 4:
    # Just do this for the conv / maxpool layers, not the fully-connected layers
    n_features = feature_map.shape[-1]  # number of features in feature map

      display_grid[:, i * size : (i + 1) * size] = x
    # Display the grid
    scale = 20. / n_features
