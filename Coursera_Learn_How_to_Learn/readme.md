If you practiced and repeated something well enough to get it into long-term memory, you can usually call it up later if you need, although you may need an occasional bit of repetition to freshen the memory up. It's never a good idea to cram your learning by repeating things many times all in one day. Because that's like trying to build muscle by lifting weights all in one day there's no time for solid structures to grow.

The easiest way to tackle procrastination is to use the Pomodoro technique. That brief, 25 minute stretch of focuses concentration followed by a bit of mental relaxation.

When we find ourselves stuck on a problem, or even if we're unsure of a situation, the course of living our daily life. It's often a good idea once you've focused directly on the situation. To let things settle back and take a bit more time. That way more neural processing can take place, often below conscious awareness in the diffuse mode. The thing is it often takes time for neural processing to take place, and time, as well, to build the new neural structures that allow us to learn something now.

The focused mode has tight spacing for the rubber bumpers, which seems to, in some sense help keep your thoughts concentrated. The diffuse mode on the other hand has more widely spaced bumpers that allow for more broad ranging ways of thinking

In essence people have two fundamentally different modes of thinking that, for the purposes of this course, we've labeled focused and diffuse.

The third step to chunking is gaining context, so you can see not just how but also when to use this chunk. Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly, repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems, so that you can see not only when to use the chunk but when not to use it.

The second step in chunking is to understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk, whether its understanding a concepts such as continental drift, seeing the connection between the basic elements of a plot for a story, grasping the economic principle of supply and demand, or comprehending the essence of a particular type of math problem.

The first step on chunking is simply to focus your undivided attention on the information you want to chunk.

Just because you see it or even that you understand it, it doesn't mean that you can actually do it. Only doing it yourself helps create the neural patterns that underlie true mastery.

As you know now recall is a powerful tool. But here's another tip, recalling material when you are outside your usual place of study can also help you strengthen your grasp of the material

There are two ways to figure something out or to solve problems. First, through sequential step-by-step reasoning and second, through a more holistic intuition.

Chunks are pieces of information, neuroscientifically speaking, that are bound together through use and often through meaning. You can think of a chunk as a scintillating network of neurons that compactly synthesizes key ideas or actions. Chunks can get bigger and more complex. But at the same time, they're a single easy to access item that you can fit like a ribbon into the slot on your working memory. Chunks are best built with focused, undivided attention, understanding of the basic idea.

To begin tapping into your visual memory system, try making a very memorable visual image representing one key item you want to remember. Beyond merely seeing, try to feel, to hear and even to smell something you're trying to remember. The funnier and more evocative the images the better. As always, repetition over several days is really helpful. Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. Try associating numbers with years or with systems you're familiar with like running times.

The second, is working memory which is like a whole blackboard they quickly fades. You can only hold about four items in your working memory. When you master a technique or concept in some sense, it compacts the ideas so they can occupy less space in your working memory when you do bring them to mind. This frees your mental thinking space so that they can more easily grapple with other ideas.

In this course, we discussed two main memory systems involved in your ability to chunk concepts. The first is long term memory which is like a storage warehouse. You need to practice and repeat in order to help store items in long-term memory so you can retrieve them more easily. Practicing and repeating all in one day is a bad idea, you want to extend your practice to several days.

Use your natural contrariness to defy the always present prejudices from others about what you can accomplish. Take pride in who you are. Especially, in the qualities that make you different. And use them as a secret talisman for success..

We're often told that empathy is universally beneficial. But it's not. It's important to learn to switch on an occasional cool dispassion that helps you to not only focus on what you're trying to learn, but also to tune people out if you discover that their interests lie in undercutting you such undercutting is all too common, as people are often just as competitive as they are cooperative.

Cajal had a deep understanding, not only of how to conduct science but also of how people just interact with one another. He warned fellow learners that there will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. This happens to everybody. Not just Nobel Prize winners. If you do well in your studies, the people around you can feel threatened. The greater your achievement, the more other people will sometimes attack and demean your efforts.

Often no matter how good your teacher and textbook are, it's only when you sneak off and look at other books or videos that you begin to see what you learn through a single teacher, or book, is a partial version of the full three dimensional reality of the subject, which has links to still other fascinating topics that are of your choosing.

In Cajal's autobiography however, he pointed out that although brilliant people can do exceptional work, just like anyone else they can also be careless and biased. Cajal felt the key to his own success was his perseverance. What he called the virtue of the less brilliant, coupled with his flexible ability to change his mind and admit errors. Anyone, Cajal noted, even people with average intelligence, can change their own brains so that even the least gifted can produce an abundant harvest.

One thing is becoming clear, we can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think. I love reading history and being inspired by the biographies of extraordinary people.

The importance of working with others doesn't just relate to learning. It's also important in career building. A single small tip from a teammate to take a course from the outstanding Professor Passionate, or to check out a new job opening, can make an extraordinary difference in how your life unfolds.

Sometimes people are concerned that starting a problem and then pulling away from it, might cause confusion on an examination. This doesn't seem to be a problem for most people. After all, chefs learn to bring various facets of a dinner together, but if you still have worries about whether this strategy might work for you, try it first on homework problems.

The only trick with this approach is that you must have the self discipline to pull yourself off a problem once you find yourself stuck for a minute or two. For most students, it's easy. For others, it takes discipline and willpower.

What to do? Easy problems first or hard? The answer is to start with the hard problems, but quickly jump to the easy ones. Here's what I mean. When the test is first handed out to you, first, take a quick look to get a sense of what it involves. You should do this in any case. Then, when you start working the problems, start first with what appears to be the hardest problem. But still yourself to pull away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or you get a sense so you mind not be on the right track. This does something exceptionally helpful. Starting hard, loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work.

The story you tell yourself about why you're stressed makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best. It can really improve your performance. Another good tip for panicky test takers is to momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath.

You have not truly learned something unless you can teach it to others. Teach those ideas to others, and you will find that they will continue to resonate and deepen in your own mind.

But the focus in formal education is on the product of learning, not the process of learning. In this course, we've tried to give you a better sense of the learning process.

The truth is, you've always been in the driver's seat, when it comes to your own learning. But now that you have a better feeling for what's under your neuralhood, you could use this to help you learn new things all during your lifetime. What we're hoping is that, as the days and months will pass, you'll continue to bring to mind some of the key ideas you've learned in the course. Approaches such as switching your mode of thinking from focused to diffuse, can help reduce your frustration, and allow for more creative problem-solving. Strengthening your chunking, can give you a firmer grasp of the material. Even seemingly tiny changes in your daily approach to your work using the Pomodoro technique for example, can make a dramatic long-term difference in your learning and in your ultimate success.
