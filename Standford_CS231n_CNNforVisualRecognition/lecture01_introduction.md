## A brief history of computer vision

Stages of Visual Representation:
* Input image: perceived intensities
* Edge image: primal sketch, edges, curves, boundaries
* 2.5-D sketch: Local surface orientation and discontinuities in depth and in surface orientation
* 3-D model representation: 3-D models hierarchically organized in terms of surface and volumetric primities

## Course overview

* Focus on one of the most fundamental problems of visual recognition - image classification
* Many visual recognition problems are related to image classification, such as object detection , image captioning
* CNN for image classification:
  * NCE-UIUC
  * SuperVision
  * GoogleLeNet, VGG
  * MSRA

* Ingredients for Deep Learning:
 * Algorithms: such as CNN
 * Data
 * Computation: hardware like GPU

* Textbook: Deep learnig by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville.
* Philosophy:
  * Thorough and detailed: know how to write from scratch, debug and train convolutional neural networks.
  * Practical: focus on practical techniques
  * State of the art: latest material and research
