# Notes for [Tableau9 - the official guide](http://www.tableaubook.com/v9/)

## Ch1. Introduction to Tableau 9

Two kinds of Tableau files:

* Standard Tableau Workbook (.tbw file): contains worksheet and dashboard definitions only.
* Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx file): self-contained workbook with any necessary external files embedded in it.

Data pane is broken down into two sub-windows: 

* Dimension: non-number fields that categorize data 
* Measure: numeric fields that are aggregated as sums, averages and so forth.

The term `shelf` referes to a particular part of the worksheet where you can drag and drop a filed from the Data pane. The most common shelves are Columns and Rows. 

## Ch2. Basic Visulization Design

Shared axis charts are simple to create - simply drag another measure to an existing axis.

Measure Names and Measure values are a way of allowing more than one measure to appear in the same place. 

## Ch3. Connecting to Data

Connect to database, cloud, and other platforms.
